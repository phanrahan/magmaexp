Simple 8-bit CGRA primitives

These primitives may have location constraints.

If they have location constraints,
then the magma outputs blif files, not structural verilog files.

If you want to use location constraints,
then you need to use phanrahan's version of arachne-pnr.
Note the Makefile in build.
